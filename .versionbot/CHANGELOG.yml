    - subject: Do not handle uncaught exceptions
      hash: 926e19ff99d72b9b042ef413ecdb8bd8681691fa
      body: |
        When winston is configured to handle uncaught exceptions, all uncaught
        exceptions will result in a `LoggerNoContext` error being thrown, which
        obscure the real source of the error and makes it very hard to debug
        problems. Additionally, this behaviour interferes with application level
        exception handling.

    - subject: Drop typed-errors module in favor of typed-error
      hash: 86350715b48eb130f063b403765755812eba3404
      body: |
        The typed-errors module is deprecated and no longer maintained. This
        commit changes it for the typed-error module maintained by balena.
        I believe the original intention was to use the typed-error module, but
        we ended up using the typed-errors module due to a typo 😱

    - subject: Stop logging to rapid7 and rely on stdout instead
      hash: 17bc61134911d271edc6852635caee169e1bb89d
      body: |
        Balena has standardised on logging to stdout and using tools to capture
        and store the output instead of having application code log to an
        external service directly. This change follows this pattern and removes
        the direct logging to r7.
